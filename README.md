# morse-code
Arduino based Morse Code explorations (light based)

In this folder you will find:

- Sender: LED based "sender" that blinks the LED in morse code based on the text input over serial.
- Receiver: Photoresistor based "receiver" that trasnlates the light signal received in morse code and displays the result on an I2C LCD and over Serial.
- Transceiver: Sender and receiver all in one bundle. -> The circuit used in our CSE125 Engineering explorations class.
- Threshold demo: A demo designed to better understand threshold on analog values using the Arduino IDE built-in Serial Plotter.
